MUSAFIR Robot Project
Mobile Robot for Academic Research - PAF KIET - ICTRND Funded Project.
MODULAR Approach.

Arduino
--- MotorController		= Nano which controls both motors and reads encoder.
--- SensorController	= Nano which reads and filters all proximity and range sensors. -TODO-
--- MainController		= Mega which has NRF24L01+, 9-Axis IMU and Serial Comm to both Nano Controllers. -TODO-
--- PcNrfRelay			= Uno/Nano/Mega with nRF24L01+ to get Serial Data from PC and transmit. -TODO-

MATLAB -TODO-
--- Code for MATLAB based Manual Control, Plotting and Controlling.

VS -TODO-
--- Visual Studio GUIs for Manual Control, Plotting and Controlling.
